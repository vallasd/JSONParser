But right now, it looks like Gboard is actually private. In fact, so far as I can tell, not only are you not required to sign into a Google account to use it \u2014 there is no way to sign in to a Google account <em>even if you wanted to<\/em>. Queries sent through Gboard don\u2019t show up in <a href=\"https:\/\/history.google.com\/history\/?hl=en\">my Google search history<\/a>, even when I\u2019m signed into my Google account in other Google iOS apps. Only what you type in Gboard\u2019s search input field gets sent to Google, and even that is always sent anonymously.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whether this is Google\u2019s own magnanimous decision, a technical limitation in iOS, or a policy decision enforced by App Store review, I don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other notes:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Gboard is iOS-only for now, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.droid-life.com\/2016\/05\/12\/not-cool-google-googles-gboard-awesome-new-keyboard-ios-may-come-android\/\">but Android users seem to want it<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Design-wise Gboard is a little weird. All of Google\u2019s recent iOS apps use Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/design\/spec\/material-design\/introduction.html\">Material Design<\/a> visual language, including the Roboto font. Their iOS apps look and work a lot more like Android apps than iOS apps. Gboard, however, was visually designed to mimic the standard iOS keyboard very closely. Gboard sports slightly different colors and changes a few key placements,<sup><a href=\"http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/#fn1-2016-05-12\">1<\/a><\/sup> but is clearly designed to look like the familiar system keyboard \u2014 I\u2019ll bet many users will think Gboard is only adding a search bar above the system keyboard. (Third-party keyboards in iOS can\u2019t merely modify the system keyboard \u2014 they must reimplement just about everything from scratch.<sup><a href=\"http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/#fn2-2016-05-12\">2<\/a><\/sup>)<\/p>\n\n<p>But Gboard uses Roboto instead of SF. The differences between Roboto and San Francisco are sometimes subtle, but to my eyes it just makes it look out of place on iOS 9. Also, they chose too thin a weight of Roboto \u2014 I can barely see the period on their \u201c.\u201d key. I think the whole Material Design thing feels terribly out of place on iOS. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t do it with Gboard, but they should have gone the whole way and used San Francisco for the typeface, too.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Gboard has some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/5-reasons-to-install-googles-keyboard-on-your-ios-device\/\">interesting emoji features<\/a>. First, rather than make you switch to a different keyboard, it has its own dedicated emoji layout built in, including search. Mac OS\u2019s \u201cEmoji and Symbols\u201d picker has long allowed for search; it\u2019s long struck me as a little curious that iOS\u2019s standard emoji keyboard does not. Second, Gboard\u2019s predictive text feature will suggest emoji in addition to actual words. Type \u201cdinner\u201d and the first predictive suggestion is \u201c\ud83c\udf74\u201d; type \u201cbasketball\u201d and you get \u201c\ud83c\udfc0\u201d. That\u2019s clever.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Update:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/730946152309395459\">Federico Viticci<\/a>: \u201cThere must be people at Google who <em>really<\/em> don\u2019t get the iPad. Gboard is very good on the iPhone; the layout is atrocious on the iPad Pro.\u201d I didn\u2019t even think to try it on an iPad \u2014 for some reason I\u2019ve got it in my head that third-party keyboards are an iPhone-only thing on iOS.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Update 2:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rajanpatel\/status\/730983424706547717\">Rajan Patel, on Twitter<\/a>, regarding this article:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@daringfireball It was our magnanimous decision, we should go all\nthe way w\/ design, and we will polish iPad.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Update 3:<\/strong> Another cool feature.

If you abstract too\nmuch, the glyph doesn\u2019t feel tied to the history and soul of\nInstagram. If you make it too literal, it\u2019s hard to justify\nchanging from what we currently have.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a lot of refinement, we landed on a glyph that still\nsuggests a camera, but also sets the groundwork for years to come.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Instagram seems like a \u201c<em>measure twice, cut once<\/em>\u201d sort of company. Deliberative, almost to a fault. Even if you disagree with the direction in which they\u2019ve taken their brand today, do not think for a second that they did this on a whim. They stuck with the old skeuomorphic camera icon for years after everyone else went flat. Now they\u2019ve gone with something very different, and very abstract. I like the idea, but I\u2019m not sure I care for the rainbow gradient they arrived at. The combination of a white device against a colorful gradient background reminds me quite a bit of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.authenticvintageposters.com\/site\/gallery.php?gid=93\">some iPod ads from a decade ago<\/a>. The colors they chose don\u2019t look connected to the colors of the old icon\u2019s rainbow. In short, it looks and feels like an altogether new brand for Instagram, not an update or refresh of their old brand \u2014 and I\u2019m not convinced that was the right move. Even something as simple as keeping the \u201cleather\u201d on the top half of the camera, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ianstormtaylor\/status\/730458234608181248\">as proposed here<\/a> by Ian Storm Taylor, would have preserved more of the original brand.<\/p>\n\n<p>The changes within the app, I definitely like. Spalter describes the changes thusly:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While the icon is a colorful doorway into the Instagram app, once\ninside the app, we believe the color should come directly from the\ncommunity\u2019s photos and videos. We stripped the color and noise\nfrom surfaces where people\u2019s content should take center stage, and\nboosted color on other surfaces like sign up flows and home\nscreens.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As with the icon, it\u2019s a polarizing change. It\u2019s severely black and white. Given that we spend more time <em>in<\/em> the app rather than looking at its home screen icon, I\u2019m a little surprised they didn\u2019t go with one of the black-and-white <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/5\/11\/11656610\/instagram-new-app-icon-redesign-mockups-design\">icon designs they considered<\/a>, to make the icon match the UI.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some reactions from around the web:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BFRPEhvgBJt\/\">Kevin Systrom\u2019s post announcing the new look<\/a> has over 700 comments. To my eyes, most of them are negative. But that\u2019s always the case with radical icon changes. Some people will genuinely dislike any new icon; it\u2019s the change itself they dislike \u2014 the loss of something familiar. If you allowed users to vote on it, no popular app would ever get a new icon.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Tim Nudd, writing for Adweek: \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/advertising-branding\/instagrams-new-logo-travesty-can-we-change-it-back-please-171398\">Instagram\u2019s New Logo Is a Travesty.
